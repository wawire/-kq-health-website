# Test Vercel Preview

This is a test file to demonstrate Vercel preview deployments.

## What This Demonstrates:

When you create a Pull Request with this branch:

1. **Vercel will automatically:**
   - Detect the new PR
   - Build a preview deployment
   - Comment on the PR with a preview URL
   - Example: `https://kq-health-website-git-test-preview.vercel.app`

2. **You can then:**
   - Click the preview URL
   - See this exact file in the deployment
   - Test all changes before merging
   - Share the URL with your team

3. **After reviewing:**
   - If satisfied → Merge the PR
   - If changes needed → Push more commits (preview auto-updates)
   - If not wanted → Close the PR (preview gets deleted)

## Try It:

1. Push this branch to GitHub
2. Create a Pull Request
3. Wait for Vercel comment with preview URL
4. Click the URL and see this file!

**Delete this file after testing the Vercel preview workflow.**
